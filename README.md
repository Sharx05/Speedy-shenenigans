# MicroFortnight Clock üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Code Duo


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Shakirath ul Mubishira - College of Engineering Perumon
- Member 2: Sharath H - College of Engineering Perumon

### Project Description
A playful web app that tells time in absurd units like microfortnights, beard-seconds, jiffies, and Smoots/day. Smooth animations, a unit randomizer, and tongue-in-cheek achievements make waiting feel scientifically silly.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Normal clocks are too useful and sensible. Where‚Äôs the whimsy in knowing it‚Äôs 3:27 PM when you could know it‚Äôs 8.9 million microfortnights past brunch?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A React app that converts the current time into niche and nonsensical units, with animated transitions, a unit picker, and a never-ending sense of progress.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: TypeScript
- Frameworks: React, Vite
- Libraries: Tailwind CSS, dayjs, framer-motion, clsx
- Tools: pnpm, ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Pages (or Vercel) for deploy

For Hardware:
- N/A

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
- Ensure Node.js >= 18 and pnpm installed
- Clone repo
- pnpm install

# Run
- pnpm dev (start the dev server)
- pnpm build (production build)
- pnpm preview (preview production build)

Key Modules (planned):
- `units.ts`: conversions for microfortnight, beard-second, jiffy, Smoots/day, dog-years/min, and more
- `useTimeStore.ts`: reactive time ticker and selected unit state
- `Clock.tsx`: main display with animated transitions
- `UnitPicker.tsx`: select or randomize units
- `AchievementToast.tsx`: playful milestones at arbitrary thresholds
