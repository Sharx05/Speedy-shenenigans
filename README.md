### Project Description
Speedy Shenanigans is a web-based utility that reimagines the standard internet speed test. Instead of just displaying numbers and graphs, our website measures a user's data transfer speed (download, upload, and latency) and provides real-time feedback through a library of funny and context-aware audio clips. The goal is to transform a mundane, technical task into an entertaining and memorable and annoying  user experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The user should aware about the data speed

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a website to make aware  the user's about the  data speed and we provide funny memme audios for a better and annoying experience
